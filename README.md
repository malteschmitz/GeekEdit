GeekEdit
========

Windows Code Editor, which is entirely configurable with [PascalScript](http://www.remobjects.com/ps.aspx).

This project is available mainly for documental reasons. It was superseded by many cool projects such as [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/).

See [bin/GeekEdit.txt] for a more complete documentation. [Binaries available on my website](https://www.mlte.de/code/geekedit).
